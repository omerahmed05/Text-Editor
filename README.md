# Text Editor (C++)

This is a simple text editor built in C++, inspired by old-school editors like Emacs and Vi. It allows the user to insert new lines, delete lines, and navigate through the text.

## Features

- Line-based editing: add, remove, and move through lines of text.
- Linked list implementation: each line is stored as a node in a linked list, making insertions and deletions efficient.

## Planned Future Features

- Undo and redo functionality
- Search and replace
- File read and write operations
- Syntax highlighting

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to strengthen understanding of C++ fundamentals such as pointers, dynamic memory, and data structures, while creating a functional console-based text editor. As my C++ knowledge grows, I will continue to add features.
